In Depth
========

Breaking changes
----------------

Mono 5.0 implements the dotnet 4.6 behavior regarding CultureInfo.CurrentCulture and CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture. On previous versions they used to be stored on thread-locals but now are stored on the execution context, meaning their values follow async Tasks. For more information see [MSDN page] (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt761774.aspx)

On the current release is not possible to revert to the old behavior using AppContextSwitches, this should change in future releases.

C# compiler
-----------

### csc

The [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) C# compiler is now available on Mono and it's called `csc`. It's the same compiler available on Windows / Visual Studio with full support for C#7. Both msbuild and xbuild have been updated to call the `csc` compiler under the hood instead of `mcs`.

Replacing `mcs` with `csc` in user scripts should be straightforward but small issues can arise as command line arguments accepted by csc and features are not identical to mcs. For example, `csc` generates Portable PDB (.pdb) debug files instead of Mono's MDB (.mdb) format. It also can't do full signing on non-Windows platforms, use the `/publicsign` switch instead or use delay signing and sign the assembly with the `sn` tool after the build.

The following new C#7 features are now available:

* Tuples
* Pattern Matching
* Local Functions
* Extended expression bodied members
* out var declaration
* Binary literals
* Digit separators
* Generalized async return types
* throw expressions
* ref locals and returns

### mcs

The Mono C# compiler is still available but it has not been updated to include C#7 features. The compiler is still maintained and all reported bugs have been fixed.

MSBuild
-------

Over the past year we have been working to integrate the opensourced `msbuild` build
tool into Mono. It is now available as part of your Mono installation, and it is
the same [MSBuild](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild) that is used
on .NET on Windows.

Thie resolves numerous incompatibilities we had in our previous `xbuild` implementation.

### xbuild

Mono's historical implementation of MSBuild called `xbuild` is now deprecated. We encourage everyone to switch to the `msbuild` command which is now available on Mono as well.

### Reference assemblies

The reference assemblies were updated to fully match the .NET 4.6.2 API set. This means that you no longer get compilation errors about missing classes/methods when building against one of the .NET profiles via msbuild/xbuild.

Note that at runtime certain APIs that Mono doesn't (yet) implement will still throw an exception.

Tools
-----

### pdb2mdb

The `pdb2mdb` tool was updated so it no longer crashes when run against an assembly that has a Portable PDB debug symbols available.

### nunit

Deprecation of Mono bundled version of NUnit:

Mono used to ship with a forked copy of NUnit 2.4 that we used for testing Mono itself.
For historical reasons it was never updated and is ancient at this point (it was released nearly 10 years ago!).

We moved to nunitlite for testing Mono so we decided to deprecate the version we ship.

The `nunit-console` command will print a warning now. Compiling new projects against the NUnit DLLs from GAC
will fail with an error message (existing test assemblies continue to work).

We recommend that you use a recent version of NUnit from NuGet or the project's website instead.

CoreFX + Reference Source Adoption
----------------------------------

As we [announced](/news/2016/11/29/mono-code-sharing/) we are
adopting a new strategy to share code with .NET. With this release we started
this effort where the code is shared between .NET Core and Mono and not just the Reference Source release.

Windows
-------

The build system was fixed so it works without setting the
`git config --global core.autocrlf input` setting which makes building
Mono on Windows easier.

macOS
-----

### AppleTLS stack ###

The Mono.framework package that we distribute for macOS now uses the
AppleTLS stack for implementing our SSL/TLS transport.  This brings
full support for TLS 1.2 for `SslStream` and our various HTTP web
clients.

In the initial preview release, AppleTLS has two known issues:

* Under certain circumstances, programs using AppleTLS may halt and present a GUI dialog requesting keychain access. [More information and bugzilla entry here](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54469).
* SecCertificateCreateWithData, and thus many X.509 functions, currently behave differently when given an invalid certificate on each of 10.9, 10.11, and 10.12. [Bugzilla entry here](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53689).

We do offer a way of using the old SSL/TLS stack. Set the
`MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable to `legacy` to use the old
Mono managed TLS 1.0 stack.   From your shell, you can do it like this:

```bash
export MONO_TLS_PROVIDER=legacy
```

libJPG Update in MacOS Package
------------------------------
The MacOS SDK package now contains an updated libjpeg library that resolves the issue described in [CVE-2013-6629](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6629). Our Mono distribution for the Mac now includes an updated libjpg.

Runtime
-------

### SIMD Acceleration support ###

Generating SIMD accelerated native code for the classes in the
`Mono.Simd` assembly is deprecated in this release, and it will be
removed in +2 releases. Users should transition to using the Vector
classes, which are part of the official .NET class libraries.

### Environment Memory Management And System.Configuration ###

As per the Unix specification, getenv may return a pointer into static memory. Future calls to getenv can overwrite
the memory returned from previous calls to getenv. Mono kept many pointers into this memory while concurrently calling
getenv on multiple threads. We now lock around the environment-changing functions and to duplicate all returned strings.
Unfortunately, Mono will use the environment to find which configuration file to read for System.Configuration.
Configurations that were set might not have been used, as managed code was seeing nulls. This is how the bug surfaced, it
is not hypothetical. Users who set a custom configuration file (via `MONO_CFG_DIR`) are encouraged to check that using
previously-ignored configuration files does not lead to unexpected breakage.

### Match semantics of rethrow instruction with .NET runtime ###

Mono used to cut off the stack trace at the point where an exception is
rethrown, however, it should retain the stack trace if `rethrow` [is
used](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182363.aspx).

### Experimental runtime interpreter ###

We revived the interpreter back from the old days (aka. `mint`).  It now
supports generics, and was updated to match internal API changes. It is
disabled per default and shouldn't be used in production yet.

The interpreter will be an execution option to the current runtime.

### Clean-ups around native crashes ###

Native crashes now end up a single handler `mono_handle_native_crash`, that
tries to provide as much information as possible.  Also, `SIGILL` won't get
wrapped into a managed exception anymore but results into a native crash.

### Internal Documentation ###

We have enabled Doxygen for [documentation of runtime internals](/api/).
Going forward, this should help us onboard new contributors
and make the codebase easier to navigate and understand.

### Lazy array interfaces ###

One curious aspect of C# is that arrays implement invarient interfaces as if they were covariant. This happens for `IList<T>, ICollection<T> and IEnumerable<T>` which means, for example, that `string[]` implements both `IList<string>` and `IList<object>`.

Mono traditionally implemented this by creating the runtime-side metadata for all of those interfaces and that came with an extraordinary memory cost of creating a lot of interfaces that never ended up being referenced by C# code.

With Mono 5.0 we now treat those interfaces as magic/special and use a different casting codepath. This allow them to be lazily implemented in arrays, which can save a lot of memory in LINQ-heavy workloads. As part of this work we refactored the casting code in the JIT to be simpler and more maintainable.

### Memory usage ###

Improvements in the runtime representation of the type system should yield a 5% memory saving
in most workloads. It was archieved by using a more efficient representation for arrays and generic instances.

A linearalizable property bag was added to replace the current mechanism of rare fields in runtime metadata.
More rarely used fields were moved to use it as they now use significantly less memory when used.

### SGen Improvements ###

As of this release we are enabling concurrent SGen as the default mode
on desktop platforms. This mode significantly reduces the time spent
in major collections, by doing most of the work concurrently with the
application. In order to use the old serial collector you can pass to
the environment `MONO_GC_PARAMS=major=marksweep`.

A new parallel SGen mode has been added for majors. This mode uses
multiple workers in order to finish a concurrent collection and it is
currently experimental. If you are still experiencing large pauses with
the concurrent collector, you can try out the parallel mode by passing
`MONO_GC_PARAMS=major=marksweep-conc-par`.

SGen uses an optimized custom implementation of quicksort to improve
the performance of some GC operations. Previously, it selected a poor
choice of pivot, which could lead to worst-case time complexity in
some circumstances. It has been rewritten with an improved pivot
strategy.

This release includes some performance improvements in ephemeron
processing, which also translate to shorter collections. Ephemerons
are an internal structure used by the SGen to implement the semantics
of ConditionalWeakTable. This also includes a fix for a long-standing
leak when using and disposing of a lot of these structures.

Major block allocation and freeing was tweaked in order to reduce
fragmentation of the virtual memory space.

### SIMD Register Scanning ###

Certain compiler optimizations can lead to object references being
stored in SIMD registers, for example, during an optimized copy of an
array of references. Previously, the runtime did not scan these
registers, which could cause objects to be prematurely freed if the
garbage collector happened to run while the only reference to an
object resided in such a register. The runtime now correctly scans
these registers for object references during garbage collection.

### Static Analysis ###

We are investing in static analysis of the runtime to verify our use
of locks, signals, and global state. This should help reduce
concurrency errors, improving correctness and stability. As a first
step, we have already caught some locking errors in the garbage
collector.

### Symbolification ###

The runtime crash stack traces now include information on managed stack traces to allow them to be symbolificated. Tooling was adjusted to handle the slightly different format.

### Thread.Abort harderning ###

The runtime was hardened to further its resilience in face of thread aborts.
It now won't abort in-flight class constructors.
Thread abort is important for application using multiple AppDomains.

### Thread Abort Exception ###

ThreadAbortException remains set during stack unwinding unless manually unset. While inside of a function call inside of a catch block for the exception, it was possible for us to see the set ThreadAbortException and behave as if the call inside of the catch block threw it. This has been fixed.

### Unwinding on Android ###

On a native crash on Android, the Mono runtime tried to `dlopen` libcorkscrew
or libunwind (depending on what is available) in order to obtain a native stack
trace. However, this approach was unreliable, as some devices don't even
ship said libraries. Furthermore, Android will restrict the `dlopen` syscall
in an unfavorable way for this approach in a future version.

We changed our approach by trying to do _less_ work: We now rely on a system
process by Android aka. `debuggerd` to provide us a native stack trace. On some
Android versions this requires us to set `DUMPABLE`.

### Workaround for netstandard nugets on desktop ###

Some netstandard NuGets like System.IO.Compression resolve to assemblies that won't work with Mono on Desktop. To handle this we implemented a series of workarounds:

* Deny loading problematic assemblies. They will be handled as if they did not exist
* Deny remapping to problematic assembly versions. The system version will be used instead.

### Windows Support ###

Mono can now run on Win64.

### Bring PowerPC back to life ###

Mono can bootstrap on `ppc64le`.
